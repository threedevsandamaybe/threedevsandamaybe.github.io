This episode we are very lucky to be joined by Dayle Rees, to discuss all things PHP, Laravel and Colour Schemes.
Starting off conversation with how he got into PHP, we move on to his initial introduction to the Laravel framework - and his involvement during the development of versions 3 and 4.
From there we touch upon his very popular text-editor colour schemes project, and how the Code Happy/Bright books came about.
Finally, we discuss his new book 'PHPandas' which is currently being written, targeted at absolute beginners to software development.
