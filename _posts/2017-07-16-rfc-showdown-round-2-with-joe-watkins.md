In this weeks episode we catch up with Joe Watkins discussing all things PHP.
We start off the discussion with how his role as release-manager is going for PHP 7.1, highlighting how Security bugs are defined and handled within internals.
Following this we chat about several RFC's that are under-discussion (Retry Keyword, UUID) and accepted (Libsodium, Object Typehint) for the next release.
Finally, we mention a recent small extension Joe has been working on to provide user verified types within the language.
