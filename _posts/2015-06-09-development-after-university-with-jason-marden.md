This week we are lucky to have good friend of Edd's, Jason Marden on the show.
We start of discussion with how he got into programming (hacking on Flash games) and how we met at University studying for a Computer Science degree.
Moving on from this, we touch upon being introduced to Java as a first language, the presence of UML/SOAP in the real world and the importance of a white-board.
Finally, we wrap up the show with chat about Test Doubles, how his work provisions their AWS setup and advice to people looking into getting into the industry from University or another profession.
