In this weeks episode we are lucky to be joined by Scott Wlaschin again, to discuss his recent 'Thirteen ways of looking at a turtle' talk.
We start off discussion highlighting the value of solving a known problem in many different ways and the inspiration behind the talk.
This leads us on to chat about the Object-oriented and Abstract Mutable/Immutable Data Model solutions, mentioning each ones merits as a way to solve the problem.
We then move on to highlight the State, Either and Async Monad solutions, and how they aid in function composition of different 'shapes'.
Finally, we mention how good code should be boring, the balance of the abstract vs. concrete and transparency in code.
