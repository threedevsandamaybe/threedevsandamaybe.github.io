In this weeks second in-person episode, we start off by congratulating Fraser on his recent engagement.
We then move on to chat about setting up Kong, rate-limiting APIs and monitoring the health of an application system.
From here we discuss the final stages of Mick's masters dissertation, highlighting the PageRank paper and the Matthew (not Mafia) effect.
Finally, we mention Edd's trip to Silicon Milkroundabout and blog posts that he has recently had the chance to publish.
