In this screencast we take you through using the version control system Git on a day-to-day basis.
Starting off with committing a couple of files to a fresh repository, we delve into how these are internally stored and learn how to push them to an external remote.
We then move on to working through a pull-request based scenario, handling branching and merge conflicts on the way.
Finally, we collaborate with another user who checks-out our work and then makes a couple of changes of their own.
