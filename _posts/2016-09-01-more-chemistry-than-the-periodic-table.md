In this weeks episode we start off the show by catching up on the 'programming filled' holidays both Edd and Mick have just come back from.
We then move on to discuss Mick's photo-shoot?!, Edd's half-marathon training and highlight our deployment/testing processes.
Finally we 'Shave the Yak' and discuss event-oriented system design - highlighting how it has been used in a recent project and the pros n' cons of such an approach.
