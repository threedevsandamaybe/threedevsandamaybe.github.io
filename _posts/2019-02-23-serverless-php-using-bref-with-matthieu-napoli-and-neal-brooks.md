In this weeks episode we are lucky to have both Matthieu Napoli and Neal Brooks on the show to discuss all things Serverless PHP.
We start off by discussing what drew Matthieu to Serverless, the creation of the Bref project and the technical challenges encountered with getting PHP to work within the Lambda environment.
From here, we touch upon the reasons behind moving from the Serverless Framework to SAM (for the 0.3 release) and how Bref uses the new Lambda Layers and Runtime API.
This leads us on to highlight how a typical PHP project would use Bref, the decision to be opinionated in order to stay minimal and the experimental Loop SAPI.
Finally, we envision what the future holds for the Bref project and Serverless compute.
