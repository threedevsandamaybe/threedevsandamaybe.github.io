In this weeks episode we are joined again by Brian Moses to discuss several of his recent system builds.
We start off the show delving into his recent EconoNAS, highlighting the goals behind the build and how he goes about selecting the hardware parts.
We then discuss his experience using White-label HDD's for the first time.
From here, we move on to discuss his HTPC - again highlighting the goals and the experience of live-streaming the build.
This leads us on to highlight the AMD Ryzen Threadripper/Intel Coffee Lake i9 series of CPU's, Graphics card pricing and the Steam Link Box.
Finally, we look at what's in store for his upcoming DIY NAS 2018 build, FreeNAS AMD support and the different available SSD connectors.
