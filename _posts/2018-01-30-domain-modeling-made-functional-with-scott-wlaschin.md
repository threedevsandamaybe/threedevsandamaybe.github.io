In this weeks episode we chat to Scott Wlaschin about his new book 'Domain Modeling Made Functional'.
We start off the show discussing how the book came to be, the process of writing a book and melding the worlds of Domain Modeling/Functional Programing.
This leads us on to highlight what Domain Driven Design is, the importance of communication and the difference between the solution/problem space to garner a shared model.
Finally, we touch upon some of the common patterns that come out of modeling domains such as - how Entities and Value Objects provide identity, maintaing invariants using Aggregates, and communication between modals via Anti-Corruption Layers.
