On this weeks episode we are lucky to be joined by Jason Marden, to discuss the world of Amazon Web Services.
We start off the show talking about Jason's recent visit to the AWS Summit in London, and what the talking points were from the conference.
From here we delve into the Serverless Architecture, how AWS Lambda is paving the way of FAAS, containers and view-based aggregation services.
The Immutable Server is next brought up, highlighting the change in deployment philosophy that can be achieved by using such a concept.
Finally, we discuss the value of a good debugger, bringin' back awesome screen-savers and the craze of Pokemon Go.
