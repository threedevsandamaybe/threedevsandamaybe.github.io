This week we are lucky to have Simon Holywell on the show to talk all things Functional Programming.
Initially starting off with a concrete definition of Functional Programming, we move on to a brief history of the paradigm and immutability.
Following this we explain recursion (and tail-recursion), along with closures and higher-order functions.
From this base we are able to then talk about the different languages available to you which cater towards the functional mindset (i.e. Haskell).
We then set our sights on the PHP language and what/wish it had to offer when exploring the functional paradigm.
Finally, we mention his upcoming book, along with experiences presenting at user-group meet-ups.
