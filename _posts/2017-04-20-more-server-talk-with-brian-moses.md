In this weeks episode we are again lucky to be joined by Brian Moses, to continue our discussion on building your own home server.
We start off by highlighting what ECC memory is and its' value in a home server setup.
Following this, we chat about looking into the second-hand market for hardware components - as an option to find a good deal.
This leads us on to discuss overclocking hardware, threads vs. cores within a CPU and what Hyper-threading actually is.
Finally, we mention some different NAS Operating System solutions and Brain's foray into the world of Quadcopters.
