In this week's episode we start off the show with chat about Fraser's recent work event up in Newcastle and his experiences with Raspberry Pi's, Bluetooth Beacons and Promise Library memory-leaks.
We then move on to chat about how large the JavaScript landscape has become, Mick's experience at the PHP UK Conference he recently attended and his new found interest in Microservices.
This leads us on to discuss techniques used to manage application logs, teaching a 'non-techie' person some web programming and visualizing sorting algorithms.
Finally, we wrap up the show with chat about product release cycles, product owners and QA teams.
