In this weeks show we introduce error handling, focusing on how exceptions are used.
Initially touching on a brief history of exception's origins, we move on to highlight how languages such as PHP and JavaScript implement them.
We round up the chat with a 'pros and cons' breakdown and a fun-packed quiz.
