In this weeks episode we are lucky to be joined by Joe Watkins.
We start off discussion around the development of PHP 7.1 and the recent initial alpha release.
Following this, we give an update on a couple of previously mentioned RFC's, along with how Joe's ones are doing.
This leads us on to highlight how some small proposed changes are paving the way to optimal machine-code and finally integration of a JIT compiler.
Some of these proposed changes may result in backwards compatibility breaks, we discuss this topic and when it is deemed acceptable to permit this.
Finally, we chat about memorisation, caching and how it is not really feasible to distill a standard caching interface that fits all requirements.
