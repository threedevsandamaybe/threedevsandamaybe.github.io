In this weeks episode we are joined by good friend of the show Joe Watkins.
We start off discussion with the successful release of PHP 7.1 and what is in store for Joe now as release manager for that version.
Following this, we chat about the libui and Yubico PHP wrappers he as been working on and development of a better Raspberry Pi OS.
Finally, we highlight progress made towards incorporating a JiT compiler within PHP and some interesting things you can do with Zero-width joiner's and Emoji's in Unicode.
