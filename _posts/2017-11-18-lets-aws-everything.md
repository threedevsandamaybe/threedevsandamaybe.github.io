In this week's episode Edd and Mick catch-up after another long hiatus (sorry about that).
We start off by discussing principles mentioned in the Clean Coder book, gaining confidence in code by way of tests, and Elon Musk's dream of putting a person on Mars.
Leading on from this, Edd talks about his continued venture into the internals of Bitcoin, Hardware wallets, ASIC mining USB sticks and Merkle Trees.
We then highlight MyBuilder's recent switch from dedicated servers to the AWS stack, highlighting the pros n' cons of both approaches and some gotcha's encountered along the way.
Finally, we mention some security audit and monitoring tools that have proven useful for keeping an eye on the (ever increasing) servers present in a typical setup.
