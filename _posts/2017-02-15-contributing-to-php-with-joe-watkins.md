In this weeks episode we chat to good friend of the show Joe Watkins.
We start off discussion with his recent work on creating a compute-node, dual WAN setup and accepted PHP Serbia talk on contributing to PHP without being a 'C wizard'.
From here we move on to mention some of the areas (bug tracking system and QA) that could be improved with the help of new contributors within the PHP internals ecosystem.
Finally, we highlight several recently proposed RFCs, his opinions on them and some work he is doing on a future RFC.
