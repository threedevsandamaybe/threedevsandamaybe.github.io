In this episode we are lucky to be joined by good friend of the show Joe Watkins.
We start off the podcast discussing the recent major release of pthreads (version 3) and the differences found compared to version 2.
This moves us on to touch upon the design decisions made due to changes between PHP 5 and 7, providing a good API to the user, volatility and immutability considerations and installing extensions within PHP 7.
We finally bring up the progress being made in moving over other extensions such as APCu and uopz, helping out with other projects such as Xdebug and our delve into screencasting.
