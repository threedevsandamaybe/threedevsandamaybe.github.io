This week we have a three developer podcast with discussion on a host of topics.
We kick off with how Fraser has enjoyed building his first bonus slot game, written entirely in JavaScript and HTML5.
Preprocessors are a huge part of the JavaScript ecosystem at this time, with so many to choose from we discuss a couple of the more popular ones.
This leads on to Photoshop discussion, ReactJS, the cool features present in ES6 and how you can use them today with transpilers.
Following this we move on to the SOLID principles, the overuse of inheritance, technical debt and the concept of Over-DRY vs. Software Value.
This then takes us on to a strange 'rubber duck' example Edd conjured up to help try and explain the Liskov substitution and Interface segregation principles.
Finally, we discuss Edd's media server setup and how he has got it to a staged that he is finally happy with it.
