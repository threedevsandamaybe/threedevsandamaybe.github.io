In this weeks episode we start off discussion on the latest Apple event, what we think the next big product will be (the Apple Hat?!) and phone battery life woes.
We then move on to chat about immutable design considerations, controlling mutation to aid performance and being bit by values vs. references.
From here we highlight how profilers such as Blackfire are a great way of benchmarking/profiling your application - providing statistics over only your own intuitive claims.
Finally, we mention database backup strategies, AVL trees and adding AirPlay support to your Vinyl deck.
