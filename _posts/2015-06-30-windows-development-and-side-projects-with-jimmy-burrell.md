This week we are very lucky to be joined by long-time listener of the show Jimmy Burrell.
We start of discussion with interesting use-cases for monkey-patching in PHP and your responsibility to written code.
From this we move on to chat about HostSignalz, touching on Jimmy's experience developing within Visual Studio and the Windows platform.
Jimmy then discusses his journey into software development and how he stays up-to-date with the latest technologies.
Finally, we announce the winner of the recent Space Beer Cave T-shirt competition and somehow get onto the topic of Michael Jordans career.
