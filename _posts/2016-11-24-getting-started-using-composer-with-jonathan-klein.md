In this weeks episode we are joined by Jonathan Klein to discuss his recently released Composer Pluralsight course.
We start off by discussing the problem Composer is trying to solve, followed by past attempts at trying to solve it in the PHP landscape.
Following this, we move on to discuss how the composer.json and composer.lock files work, the importance of versioning, the Semantic Versioning standard and how autoloading works.
Finally, we delve into a couple of lesser-known Composer features, such as the event life-cycle, scripts and the plugin architecture that is present.
