In this weeks episode we are joined by Thijs Feryn to discuss his upcoming PHP UK conference talk.
We start of the show highlighting what drew him to a Tech. evangelist role, bridging the gap between code/infrastructure and the ideas behind 'Infrastructure as Code'.
From here we move on to discuss system and infrastructure provisioning automation tools such Ansible and Terraform.
This leads on to adding Packer into the mix, moving towards immutable infrastructure, testing these automation tools and how history has a way of repeating itself.
Finally, we touch upon the philosophy behind DevOps, focusing on empathy and its core values CAMS.
