This week we are very lucky to have Edd's work college and good friend Keyvan Akbary on the show.
We start off discussing how Google Maps lied to him on his train journey down from London to the 'Garden of England' Kent.
This moves us on to talk about the exciting new greenfield project he is currently working on - following a DDD approach, comprehensive test suite and TDD.
After this we back track a few steps and chat about how he got into computing and subsequently programming - through a high school web-page and friendly competition with his brother.
Following this we delve into his University experience and how he felt happier in a work setting, which can be seen by the great experience he has been able to gain in such a short space of time.
Finally, we discuss his experiences with his own start-up, the current book he is helping write and interesting technologies that currently appeal to him.
