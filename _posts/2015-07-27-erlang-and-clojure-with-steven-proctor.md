This week we are very lucky to be joined by fellow podcaster and host of Functional Geekery - Steven Proctor.
We start off discussion with how he got into programming from a young age, and how a 100 dollar experiment turned into the Functional Geekery podcast we know today.
This moves us on to chat about Erlang/OTP and how the Actor model is used to provide such a robust language infrastructure.
Finally, we speak about how fundamental principles out-weigh concrete implementation knowledge and Proctor gives us a host of resource material for interested listeners to delve into.
