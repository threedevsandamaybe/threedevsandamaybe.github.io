This week we have yet another episode with the full podcast crew.
Discussion starts off with the journey down to help Michael in his new house, along with the *must buy* book 'Boundaries in Dating'.
We then switch topics onto how Edd is getting on using Swift, followed by the benefits of Semantic Versioning and Promises.
Responsive design then gets a mention - as we look into how the Guardian were able to decrease their responsive payload sizes.
Finally, we finish off with our thoughts on OSX Yosemite, and how you can use tools like Homebrew, Cask and Ninite (for Windows) to ease clean-installs.
