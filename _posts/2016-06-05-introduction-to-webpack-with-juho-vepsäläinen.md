In this weeks episode we talk to Juho Vepsäläinen about all things Webpack.
We start off discussion with how he got into JavaScript and what drew him to write the SurviveJS books.
Moving onto Webpack, we chat about the problem it is trying to solve, what a bundler is and how it differs from a task runner.
We highlight some of the interesting features that Webpack has to offer such as bundle splitting, integration with UglifyJS/Babel and lazy loading.
Finally, we discuss the road-map for Webpack 2, new concepts which are being integrated such as tree shaking for dead code elimination and weighing up use of CDN's for dependencies.
