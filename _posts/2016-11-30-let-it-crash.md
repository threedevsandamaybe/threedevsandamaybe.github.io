In this weeks episode Mick and Edd start off discussion with an update on Mick's masters dissertation.
We then move on to highlight the value of getting an MVP released, and the old adage that hindsight is 20/20.
Edd then brings up how he has had the chance to revisit MyBuilder's logging and monitoring infrastructure recently, re-accessing Severity levels along the way (embarrassingly missing out Critical in the podcast).
He also mentions how background processes used within the application have changed overtime - discussing the difference between Time-dependent and Continuous processes.
Finally, we chat about successfully introducing Supervisor into the stack and Erlang's 'Let it Crash' philosophy.
