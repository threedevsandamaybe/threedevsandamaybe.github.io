In this weeks episode we are joined by the creator of Zencastr, Josh Nielsen.
We start off discussion with how he got into programming and being hired as a 'webmaster' at the University he attended.
From here, we move on to highlight the problem Zencastr is trying to solve, delving into some of the technical aspects and corners that were cut to focus on the primary solution.
Finally, we mention the testing strategy in place, how it is changing as the product stabilises and what features are next in the pipeline.
