On this weeks show we start off proceedings with Edd's experience developing and deploying a JavaScript centric application - mentioning an example application he is currently working on to document use of Flux, React, Webpack and Karma.
We then move on to highlight the sites hosting switch to Jekyll and S3, and how we have been able to get download statistics back thanks to S3Stat.
Following on from this we discuss configuration formats, how Mick was able to get disconnected by his ISP due to his finial year project and Fraser's exploration into Ionic.
Finally, we wrap up the show touching upon the Natural Computation book Edd is currently reading and a couple of interesting developer related shows available on BBC Radio 4.
