In this weeks show we are discussing all things SPL (Standard PHP Library), used to solve commonly found problems in an OO-PHP manner.
After a brief tangent on what each cast member uses for placeholder text/images, we touch upon the key reasons for SPL's development.
Following this we highlight a few of the many data-structures (fixed-array, doubly linked-list) and interfaces (countable) available to you.
Finally, we wrap up the show with the regular quiz, which you've probably guessed it, is topically about the Standard PHP Library.
