In this weeks episode we start off discussion with experiences handling online payments, CRM export integration and highlight how PHPStorm can be a great SQL editor.
We then move on to mention a service that allows you to easily manage browser polyfills, and Edd chats about his experience currently making a Nokia ringtone composer web application.
Finally, we touch upon handling transactional email, depending on third-party services and using Continuation-passing style within JavaScript.
