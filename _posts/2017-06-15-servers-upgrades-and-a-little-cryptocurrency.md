In this weeks episode we start off by discussing Edd's recent Server build, touching upon the hardware specifications, OS/ZFS-pool choices and monitoring configuration.
We then move on to highlight the value in splitting up computational intensive tasks into queued jobs, defensive programming in JavaScript and handling querying ever increasing data-sets.
Finally, we talk about keeping on-top of Software/Dependency upgrades, moving over to platforms such as AWS and Ethereum.
