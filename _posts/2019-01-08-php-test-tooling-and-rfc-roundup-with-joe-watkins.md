In this weeks episode we are joined by Joe Watkins for a long overdue catchup.
We start off the show by discussing what Sandboxing is and the new Sandbox extension he has developed.
From here, we touch upon test-doubles/mocking frameworks, the reasoning behind building uopz in the past, and now componere/mimus to aid in testing.
This leads us on to highlight what test coverage is, the history of coverage tooling within PHP, and the new exciting pcov extension he has released.
Finally, we do a big ol' RFC roundup, discussing RFCs that have been accepted for PHP 7.4 (FFI, Typed Properties and Preloading) and ones under discussion (JIT and Weak References).
