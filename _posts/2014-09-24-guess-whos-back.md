With Lewis back for this weeks show we have the first full-house in sometime, this sparks conversation on what he has got upto since his last appearance.
Discussion starts with Fraser's and Edd's woes when trying to handle responsive email design - and how the relevant testing is somehow more painful than the dreaded 'IE'.
We then move on to discuss the latest release of PHPStorm, Swift and how the Clean Coders video series helps to refine our development skills.
Finally, we bring up the topic of task managers and how most of the hosts are split between using Trello and Basecamp.
