This follows on from our first screencast which touched upon how to setup a PHP extension development environment and creating a simple 'array_sum' like function.
We now further this topic by implementing a resizable-indexed array class which supplies very similar functionality to that of the SplFixedArray class.
Throughout this discussion we look into creating a custom Zend object class, using this to invoke an implemented data-structure located in another file, implementing internal interfaces, object handlers and the importance of PHP extension tests.
