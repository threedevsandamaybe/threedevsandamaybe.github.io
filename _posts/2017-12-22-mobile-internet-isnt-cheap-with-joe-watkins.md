In this episode we catch up with Joe Watkins to discuss all things PHP.
We start off discussion with his recent move to Spain, the pain of getting a good Internet connection and PHP TestFest.
This leads us on to highlight some recent work he is doing with adding PHP bindings to Bicoin's Secp256k1 library and a Generic Traits idea.
From here we touch upon the additions that made it into PHP 7.2 and some that have already been accepted for 7.3.
Finally, we get Joe's opinion on a couple of RFC's (Call-site pass-by-reference and Operator functions).
