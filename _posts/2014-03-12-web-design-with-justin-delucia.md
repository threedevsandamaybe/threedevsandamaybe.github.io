This week we are lucky to have special guest and good friend of the show Justin DeLucia on to discuss all things web design.
Starting off with background discussion on how he got into the industry, we move on to how designers and developers work (and should work) together.
Finally, we wrap up with our longest quiz yet, which undoubtedly went off in many random tangents.
