This week we start our chat off with the myth of just simply 'reskinning' a website, along with the dreaded !important in CSS.
Following this, as we love quizzes so much, we decided to dedicate a full show to one.
In this weeks quiz we touch upon many areas of PHP, JavaScript, CSS and random computer/programming history.
We also now have t-shirts on sale, available via the first link in the show-notes (why don't you treat yourself).
