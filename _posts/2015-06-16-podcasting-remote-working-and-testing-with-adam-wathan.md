This week we are very lucky to be joined by fellow podcaster and host of Full Stack Radio - Adam Wathan.
We begin discussion with his reasons behind starting a podcast, experience being a solo-host and the secret to great podcast recordings.
We then move on to how he got into programming at high school - with reflection on that if he had been using a Windows machine at college, he would most likely be a .NET developer by now.
As both Edd and Adam work remotely at this time, the topic of remote pair-programming and Kanban style board implementations then arises.
Finally, we discuss his thoughts on Message-passing vs. strict-contracts, Smalltalk and Elixir exploration and how it is hard to give a definitive answer on the best way to begin learning TDD.
