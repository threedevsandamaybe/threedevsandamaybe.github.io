In this weeks show we continue our discussion on web application frameworks by delving into CodeIgniter.
Though it has had its fair share of bad press over the past couple of years, its mature code-base and ease of getting started can not be denied.
Initially exploring what the framework is from a high-level we move on to discuss it's strengths and weaknesses along with personal experiences.
We finally wrap up the show with a CodeIgniter influenced quiz.
