In this weeks show we decided to have a good ramble about a couple of topics that have cropped us this week.
Ranging from freelance experiences, cheese-based Lorem Ipsum text, and famous Albert Einstein quotes.
By the end we start to discuss our personal software deployment strategies, briefly touching on Docker, which will be the topic of next weeks show.
