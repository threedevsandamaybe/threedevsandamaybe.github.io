This week we are lucky to have the one n' only Phil Sturgeon on the show.
Starting off conversation with how he got into programming, we move on to his time using and contributing to the CodeIngiter and FuelPHP projects.
This leads us on to discuss the current status of CodeIgniter 3.0 and his experiences with porting PyroCMS to Laravel.
Among other things we then touch upon the 'Wordpress positive feedback loop', the PHP-FIG (Framework Interop Group) and the PHP-RFC (Request for Comments) process.
We wrap up the show with some sound and interesting advice to any budding/new developer.
