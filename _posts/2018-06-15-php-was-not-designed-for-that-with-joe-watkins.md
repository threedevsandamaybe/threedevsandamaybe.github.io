In this weeks episode we catch-up with Joe Watkins.
We start off discussion with a recent blog post he wrote about the unhelpful 'just because you can, doesn't mean you should' response he sees surrounding some of his PHP extensions.
From here we move on to highlight a debugger you can 'composer require', reasons behind creating such a tool and how it works.
This leads us on to mention some updates to uopz for PHP 7 support, a weak references RFC he has recently published and future plans for PHP.
Finally, we wrap up by talking about a CommonMark extension he has published, and how CQL provides the ability to efficiently traverse a document.
