In this weeks episode we start off discussion around testing in a Continuous Integration pipeline, and setting up a personal Bamboo CI system.
We then move on to separating domain logic from the delivery, and how a Package-Bridge-Delivery split works.
After a small mouse related intermission, we touch upon experiences building custom Babel plugins and testing using Jest, Travis CI and Docker.
Finally, we highlight creating small CLI applications with Go, Serverless Offline and Logic-Gates/8-bit computers.
