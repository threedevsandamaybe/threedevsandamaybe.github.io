Originally recorded early February but only now being released (blame Edd), we are lucky to have Joe Watkins on the show again.
The show starts off with payment gateway woes, Joey Essex 'bants' and Joe's experience researching into Vitess.
We then discuss how Joe works on improving a large, mature code-base in his day job - enjoying brown-field projects as the code has already been proven in production.
Finally, we bring up the topic of working remote, discussing the pros n' cons with two very different viewpoints.
This includes, highlighting how important collaboration tools are and remote working loneliness.
