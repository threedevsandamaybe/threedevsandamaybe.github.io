In this weeks episode Mick and Edd have a long overdue catchup!
We start off the show by discussing Mick's new job, the new stack he is using, and the benefits of working in a team.
From here we highlight how his company uses Scrum (Sprints, Planning Poker and Story Points), handling event-sourced models with the introduction of GDPR, and logic within annotations.
Finally, we touch upon Edd's recent engagement and marathon, a new Serverless/React blog series he is working on, developing applications for the Ethereum blockchain, and how to manage application secrets.
