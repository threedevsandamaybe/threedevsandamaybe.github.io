In this weeks show we are lucky to have good friend of the podcast, Justin DeLucia back on.
Although he is sadly only able to stay around for half the episode, we are able to touch upon some very interesting topics in this time.
Initially starting off with discussion on baby sleeping patterns, we move on to the role of the designer and how it is slowly changing.
We follow this up with Justin's thoughts on animation within web design, and the trends he sees forming in 2015.
This leads us on to bring up the topic of mobile traffic, and how more and more users are relying on only an mobile experience.
Finally, we discuss Michael's experiences throughout his first two years into a graduate masters degree, and how above all else learning takes precedence over grades.
