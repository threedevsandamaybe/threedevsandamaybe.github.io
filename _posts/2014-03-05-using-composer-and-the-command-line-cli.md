With only a two man crew this week we decided to have a little ramble about Composer and the Command Line.
Initially discussing the benefits of Composer over alternatives (i.e. PEAR), we move onto some of the real-world issues that can arise from 'depending' on it.
We then segue into discussing the Command Line and some of the key points new users should now about.
