In this weeks episode we are joined by fellow co-host Fraser Hart.
We start off by discussing what he has been upto since his last podcast appearance - ranging from completing an Ironman, to promotions at work.
From here we highlight how he balances development with his new project managerial role, how his company has started to adopt React/Redux and moving over to Webpack 2.
Finally, we delve into the different server stacks we are using, and how the KISS design-principle plays a key-role.
