In this weeks episode we are lucky to be joined by Jimmy Burrell for a long over-due 'geek out'.
We start off discussion around his recent functional programming exploration, and how you can take many of these principles into your day-to-day OOP language.
Following this we chat about what drew Jimmy to F#, the REPL, making illegal states unrepresentable and reasoning about immutable data-structures.
From here we highlight some of F# capabilities including, pattern matching, computational expressions, type providers, currying and concurrency paradigms.
Finally, we wrap up the show discussing our experiences learning about monads, the continuation passing style, and thinking in terms of data transformations.
