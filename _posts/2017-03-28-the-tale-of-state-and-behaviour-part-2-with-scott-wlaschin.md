In this weeks show we follow on from our previous episode's discussion with Scott Wlaschin.
We delve into separating out the client from the behaviour and state, initially highlighting the Batch Command approach.
From here, we move on to discuss the Actor Modal, Event Sourcing and Functional Reactive Programming solutions.
Finally we touch upon handling the behavioural dependencies, followed by creating an Interpreter and Capability-based implementations.
