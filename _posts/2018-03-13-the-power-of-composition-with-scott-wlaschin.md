In this weeks episode we are lucky to have Scott Wlaschin back on the show.
We start of discussion by highlighting his most recent talk on composition and some useful analogies to Lego, Brio and Unix.
From here we move on to investigate function and type composition, the difference between a paradigm shift compared to simply a syntax one and the advantages of an opinionated language.
This leads us on to mention how within application design pushing the side-effects to the edge and keeping the core domain pure is beneficial.
Finally, we touch upon testing in functional languages, experiences whilst consulting and Rich Hickey's 'Effective Programs' talk.
