This week we are lucky to be joined by Guy Routledge to discuss all things CSS Preprocessor.
Starting off with a brief discussion on his journey into developing for the web, we move onto how he gets business working freelance.
Following this we bring up the topic of CSS Preprocessors - what they are, and differences that can be seen in the alternatives available (Sass, Less, Stylus).
Finally we wrap up the show with discussion on BEM, CSS 'Level 4' specifications and his experience developing the screencast 'A to Z CSS'.
