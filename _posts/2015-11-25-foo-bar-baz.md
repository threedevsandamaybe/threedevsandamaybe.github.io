In this week's show we start off discussion with Lew's upgraded audio and Mick's side-project 'Smuddle' which hopes to help fill a void in the shopping comparison site area.
We then move on to touch upon third-party email delivery solutions, task scheduling abstractions and queuing implementations.
API's and the tooling around them is next on the list along with how the JavaScript stack can be quite intimidating when you first delve into it.
Finally, we chat briefly about Hypermedia API's and look into developing and deploying web applications outside of the PHP ecosystem.
