This week on a early Sunday morning recording, we start off podcast discussion with A/B testing and Google Analytics/Experiments.
We then move on to touch upon distributing PHP console applications within PHAR's, application security and Google's recent IO conference.
Following this we bring up a couple of small projects Edd is currently working on, relating to Morse Code and Colour detection algorithms.
Finally, we wrap up the show by discussing the current Space Beer Cave competition that is still underway, and how one contestant is running away with the prize at this time.
