In this weeks episode we are lucky to have Scott Wlaschin back on the show to discuss design within software.
We start off by highlighting leaky abstractions, adopted tool-chains and transpiling languages into JavaScript.
From here we move on to talk about what makes 'good code', and how evaluating this is heavily reliant on the requirements and context you are in.
Finally, we discuss how OO and FP software architectures differ, advantages of being explicit over implicit and information-hiding at API boundaries.
