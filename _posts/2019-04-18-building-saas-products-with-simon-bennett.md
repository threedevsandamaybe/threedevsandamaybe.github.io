In this weeks episode we chat to Simon Bennett about his experience bootstrapping SaaS products.
We start off with how he got into software development and highlight some of his previous/current business ventures.
This leads us to highlight treating each failure as an experiment, and the danger (as a developer) of using a new product idea as a platform to learn new technology.
From here, we discuss the success he has had from SnapShooter, his new product Automaily, and the unique challenges building products targeted at developers.
Finally, we touch upon how he comes up with new ideas, the necessity to quickly validate them, and advice for any listener who has an idea and is thinking of building a product from it.
