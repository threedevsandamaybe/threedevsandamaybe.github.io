In this weeks episode Mick and Edd first touch upon the many new services/features that have been released at AWS re:Invent.
We then move on to discuss Serverless architecture, Server architectural patterns, Amazon Cognito and security/encryption that is available within Amazon Web Services.
This leads us on to highlight the impact of relying on a single company for all your compute/infrastructure needs and 'putting all your fish in one basket'.
Finally, Mick tells us what Santa might be bringing him for Christmas.
