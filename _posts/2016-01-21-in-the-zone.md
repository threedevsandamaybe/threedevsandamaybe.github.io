On this weeks show we start off with Mick's recent dive into React, discussing alternatives in process.
We then move on to chat about large database design, seeding databases, clean installing a Mac and external SSDs.
Following this, Edd brings up his exploration into Macros in Clojure, Immutable data-structures and interesting behavior with 'this' in JavaScript.
Finally, we wrap up the show by bringing up the topic of being in 'The Zone' when programming, what we feel about the concept, and the pros n' cons of such a mind-set.
