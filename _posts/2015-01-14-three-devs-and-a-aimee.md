It is the first show of the new year!
In this weeks episode we first reflect on how our holiday breaks went, and what happened to Edd's face?!
Fraser's move up to Greenwich is next discussed, including how useful the taxi app 'Uber' is.
We then move on to talk about Mick's experiences compiling Apache and PHP from source, along with CodeIgniter's decision to maintain 5.2 support.
This leads on to conversation about the upcoming PHP UK Conference, along with tuning queries for the database query planner.
Finally, we highlight the differences between Apache and nginx, along with their use of PHP-FPM.
