This week we are very lucky to have Jacques Woodcock and Ben Ramsey from the virtPHP project on the podcast.
Similar in nature to Python's 'virtualenv', virtPHP is a tool for creating and managing multiple isolated PHP environments on a single machine.
Currently command-line support on *nix based-systems is complete, however, during the show we touch on the challenges in-regard to SAPI support.
We then move on to discuss the interesting paths each took to get into development, followed up finally with the weekly quiz.
