This week we have good friend of the show Justin DeLucia on to help host our first dedicated Q&A episode.
Not only that, but Fraser is back! along with some crazy adventures that he discusses since his last time on the show.
We have been fortunate to receive many questions throughout the past couple of weeks, and thought it would be good to release the answers as a dedicated show.
Topics discussed include, breaking into the industry, the PDO vs. Mysqli debate, bespoke vs. off-the-shelf CMS debate and what to consider when building a Web API.
