In this weeks episode Edd and Lew start off discussion with the topic of relying on external dependencies within a project - explaining issues surrounding this practice and mitigating problems that may arise.
We then move on to chat about getting away from build systems such as Gulp, by writing your own simple build scripts which are project specific.
From here Edd mentions a simple game he created to explore using State vs. Props in React, and how interesting solutions to some-what simple problems develop overtime.
Finally, we delve into more PostgreSQL discussion and the world of statistics, highlighting the differences between cohort and time-based analysis.
