In this week's episode Edd and guest co-host Neal Brooks chat to Nicolas Grekas about all things Symfony.
We start off discussion with how he got interested in programming, his introduction to Symfony, and his journey to now working on the code-base almost daily.
This leads us on to talk about how he helped build the performance profiler Blackfire, and the importance of quantitative measurements whilst making performance improvements.
From here we highlight managing pull requests, the social factors when leading open-source projects and Symfony's continuous migration path.
Finally, we touch upon the recently released Messenger component and upcoming Symfony Contracts initiative.
