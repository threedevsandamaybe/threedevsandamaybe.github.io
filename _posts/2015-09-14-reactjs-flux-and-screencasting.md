This week we start off discussion with the topic of CSRF and Session hijacking.
We then move on to the recently released screencasts we did with Joe Watkins, and how interesting Edd found recording them.
Following this we discuss ReactJS, the Flux architecture, handling error-logging on the front-end and the JavaScript source-maps.
We wrap up the show with the emphasis of removing jQuery, how hard following a single source of truth is and 'dangerous' design patterns.
