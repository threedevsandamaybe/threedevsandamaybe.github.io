Being without a guest this episode, gave us the excuse to ramble on about many different topics that have been on our minds for the past couple of weeks.
Starting off with Michael's experience using WebSockets and Fraser's fun with setting up a sound Gulp workflow, we move on to discuss the complications rebasing in Git can get you in.
Following this, Edd rambles on about the differences between the 'Active Record' and 'Data Mapper' object-persistence design patterns - along with an interesting insight he found in-regard to TDD.
Finally, we discuss the Apple keynote from last week and how we are all pretty much sold on the Apple Watch.
