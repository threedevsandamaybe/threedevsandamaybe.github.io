This week we are very lucky to have James Watts, a core member of the CakePHP project on the show.
Initially starting off with his journey into programming, we move on to talk about the differences we find between junior and senior developers.
We then touch upon his previous start-up experience and how that resulted in him thinking more about the product as a whole.
CakePHP has been around for almost 10 years now, we discuss how he got into the project - along with the frameworks key goals.
We then move on to highlight some of the key differences/features you will find in the next major release (3.0).
Finally, we discuss his upcoming book, and his experiences with organising a large open-source community event.
