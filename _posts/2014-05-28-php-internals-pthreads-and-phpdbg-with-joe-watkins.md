This week we are very lucky to have Joe Watkins from pthreads and PHPDBG fame on the podcast.
Starting off discussion with the 'PHP Next Generation' drama, we move on to wrap-up our thoughts on the 'Is TDD dead' set of Google Hangouts.
The topic then shifts onto our guest and how he got into programming and PHP - with the creation of pthreads and PHPDBG projects discussed.
Finally, we finish off the podcast with the regular quiz.
