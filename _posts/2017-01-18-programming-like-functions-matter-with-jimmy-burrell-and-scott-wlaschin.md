In this weeks episode we are joined by Jimmy Burrell and Scott Wlaschin to discuss all things functional.
We start off the show highlighting how Scott got into programming, the reasons why he is a big fan of Smalltalk, what he means by 'Enterprise OO' and being a Humanistic programmer.
From here we discuss how he got into FP, how the paradigm came to being, what FP is to Scott and why you should consider it.
Finally, we mention the differences between types in FP over langauges such as C, the railway track metaphor he uses to help explain FP concepts and architectural patterns that are more or less suited to FP.
