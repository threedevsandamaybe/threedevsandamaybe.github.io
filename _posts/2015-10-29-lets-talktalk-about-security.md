This week we are very lucky to have Lewis back on the show after his recent move.
We discuss what he has been getting up to in his absence and how he is balancing work/life whilst being remote.
Following this, we touch upon a reinvigorated passion for software architecture, moving to a framework from bespoke solutions and the middleware pattern.
Discussion then turns towards moving from AngularJS to React/Flux and resources Edd has written and found useful whilst learning the subject.
Security is the next hot-topic with the recent TalkTalk security breach in question, an interesting pseudo-random number seed issue and SSL/TLS/HTTPS all explained.
Finally, we conclude with an update on Mick's final year project and his work with decision trees.
