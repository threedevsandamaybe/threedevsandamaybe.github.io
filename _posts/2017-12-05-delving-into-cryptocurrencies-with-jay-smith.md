In this episode we are lucky to have cryptocurrency proponent and trader Jay Smith on the show.
We start off by talking about how he got introduced to cryptocurrencies and trading, highlighting what trading actually is, and the two different schools of thought (fundamental vs. technical analysis).
From here we move on to chat about how innovations such as Bitcoin are changing the way we view money/bank, the underlying technologies that make it possible (Blockchain), and the game-theory/incentives behind it for each participant to continue 'playing the game'.
Conversation then moves on to touch upon alternative cryptocurrencies (alt-coins) and the different use-cases/advancements they are making in the space.
Finally, we highlight Bitcoins scaling dilemma, how all routes seem to effect decentralisation in some shape or form, and how he stores his private keys.
