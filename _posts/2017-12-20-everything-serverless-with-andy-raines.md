In this weeks episode we chat to Andy Raines about all things Serverless.
We start off by discussing what Serverless actually means, advantages of using such a model, design constraints it employs and how it scales.
From here we touch upon the history of how we got to the compute/infrastructure we use today: from on-premise servers, IaaS, PaaS and FaaS/BaaS.
This leads us on to highlight the 12-factor app methodology, how immutability has vast benefits in many contexts and how FaaS platforms work under-the-hood.
Finally, we mention the Serverless PHP project Andy is working on, the motivations behind it and future development he would like to see take place.
