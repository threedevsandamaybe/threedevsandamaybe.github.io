In this weeks episode we have a long overdue catch-up with Lew.
We start off by discussing what he has been upto, and a certain four-legged addition to his family.
From here we move on to chat about working on a product vs. working in an agency setting, picking your battles when refactoring and not being scared to make mistakes.
Finally, we highlight how Edd has recently used personal Homebrew taps, using Android simulators for testing and Lew's experience with Vue.js.
