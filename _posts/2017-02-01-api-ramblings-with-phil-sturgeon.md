In this weeks show we are joined by Phil Sturgeon to discuss all things API development.
We start off by mentioning Phil's new job at WeWork, Startup life/culture and switching between different development philosophies.
We move on to highlight how he got into API development, the reasons behind writing the book "Build APIs You Won't Hate" and a future video-series he has in the pipeline.
This leads on to discuss common misconceptions of REST and RPC, API tooling available and the different data-formats present.
Finally, we mention the importance of good error-handling within an API (no 200 responses!) and some of the bad-stories he has heard/encountered on the topic.
