In this weeks episode we start off the podcast with discussion around Timezones, Daylight saving time and how the Year 2038 will be an interesting one.
We then move on to highlight the results of our recent PHPStorm Twitter poll, End-to-end encryption and Hot Picks is back! (at least for one show).
Finally, we highlight the differences between Software/Hardware video-decoding and some interesting PHP function aliases.
