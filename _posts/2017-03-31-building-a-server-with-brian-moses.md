In this weeks episode we are joined by Brian Moses to discuss all things server development.
We start off the show by highlighting how he got into computers and what drew him to blogging about DIY NAS builds.
From here we touch upon the key areas of consideration when deciding on hardware (Motherboard, CPU, RAM, Storage) for a server.
Finally, we discuss the concept of RAID, the FreeNAS operating system and how he performs burn-in testing on recently built systems.

Note: apologies for some of the audio quality during the show.
