In this weeks episode we are lucky to have Steven Proctor back on the show.
We start off discussion by congratulating him on 82 episodes of Functional Geekery, and the commitment it takes to do a podcast and not just 'podfade'.
From here we move on to highlight any commonalities he notices with people getting into FP, how he stays on-top of the latest advancements and how he finds the guests he wishes to speak to.
This leads us on to compare learning functional concepts within a language you already know vs. in a totally different lanaguge which is rooted in the principles.
Finally, we chat about interesting projects that are on his radar and advice that he has for people who wish to begin exploring FP.
