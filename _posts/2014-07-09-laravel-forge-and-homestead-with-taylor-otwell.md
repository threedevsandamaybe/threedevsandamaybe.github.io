This week we are very lucky to have the creator of Laravel, Taylor Otwell on the show.
Starting off with his journey into the world of programming (through .NET), we move on to discuss how Laravel came to being.
We then touch upon our experiences experimenting with different programming stacks, and what features of C# he would like to see introduced into PHP.
Finally, we ask Taylor what resources he would recommend to someone just starting out in the industry.
