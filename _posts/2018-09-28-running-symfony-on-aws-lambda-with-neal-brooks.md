In this weeks episode we are lucky to be joined by Neal Brooks, a fellow developer of Edd's at MyBuilder.
We start off by discussing how he got into programming, QBasic and video driver shenanigans.
From here, we move on to introduce his SymfonyLive London talk 'Running Symfony on AWS Lambda'.
We highlight what drew him to Lambda, and the new tooling that is making it easier to run PHP and frameworks (such as Symfony) on it.
This leads us to cover his demo application, and explore handling assets using S3, database migrations and AWS resources using CloudFormation.
Finally, we debate using catch-all gateway endpoints vs. dedicated gateway endpoints and Lambda performance.
