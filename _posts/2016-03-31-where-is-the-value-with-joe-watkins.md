In this week's episode we start off discussion with a recent PHP RFC Joe has been working on in-regard to typed properties, bringing up the value (if any) surrounding getters and setters.
We then move on to Joe's views on designing a programming language, and his mind-set that there should be no defined scope surrounding the features that the language should adopt.
Finally, we wrap up the show with an update on how stabilisation of uopz is going for PHP 7, along with a reflection on the 'Hacking on PHP 7' screencasts we released earlier this month.
