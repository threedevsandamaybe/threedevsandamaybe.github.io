On this weeks episode we are lucky to be joined by good friend of the show Justin DeLucia.
We start off discussion with what Fraser has been up-to recently, porting a code-base over to Webpack and experimenting with VR headsets.
This leads us on to chat about Justin's recent move to Wales, reflecting on his experiences working remotely, the value of communication and how he now handles clients.
Finally, Justin then highlights the differences in work and web cultures in his new surroundings and the pros n' cons he has faced since moving away from the office setting.
