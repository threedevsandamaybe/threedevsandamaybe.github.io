Hey folks! Sod's law but just as we were getting into our stride recording this week the technology failed us! Thankfully we managed to ramble a sufficient amount before this happened.

Finally the 4 of us all were online to together so lot's to catch up on i.e. Mike's fascinating computer animation module, Fraser's React.JS workshop among other usual ramblings. It also looks like we may have Adam from the popular web podcast 'Full Stack Radio' joining us soon which we all look forward to.

So without further ado, enjoy the rest and thanks for listening as well as your feedback.
