On this weeks episode we are joined by Jonathan Klein to discuss all things application performance.
We start off the show with chat about how he got into performance, why it is so important and how he thinks of it throughout the development process.
From here we discuss his recently released Pluralsight course on 'High Performance PHP' and touch upon some of the key performance areas within the stack.
Starting with micro-optimisations at the code level, we highlight their value and caching mechanisms.
We then move onto the web server, process managers and the importance of a correct configuration.
The Database layer is then brought up, discussing forks of MySQL, handling slow-queries and data-denormalizations.
Finally, profiling and monitoring tools are discussed (such as New Relic and Seige) and where you can typically find the most wins within a typical stack.
