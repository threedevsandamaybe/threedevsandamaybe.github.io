On this episode (where Edd says 'You Know' alot!) we start off with discussion surrounding Lew's recent move.
Following this, we chat about odd IE 9 bugs, PostgreSQL Query Optimiser internals, the NPM left-pad saga and Lumen.
This leads us on to discuss different Database GUI applications, Lew's fun with public-key API authentication and the anti-pattern of striving for 'pretty' URLs.
Finally, we bring up the topic of handling email delivery, using DigitalOcean to host podcast episodes and an interesting tidbit on the 'break' control structure in PHP.
