On this weeks show we start off discussion around what we have been up to away from the keyboard, and an update on Mick's big freelance project.
We then move on to the pros n' cons of being tied into an ecosystem such as AWS, React performance, Micro-services and the expected FUD outcry when a web application makes a significant change.
Finally, we chat about how important logging and monitoring are within an application, and how it can become tricker to track down issues when a system is sufficiently large or a sum of many parts.
