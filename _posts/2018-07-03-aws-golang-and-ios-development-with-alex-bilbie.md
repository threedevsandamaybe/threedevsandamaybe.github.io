In this weeks episode we are lucky to be joined by Alex Bilbie to discuss all things AWS, Golang and iOS development.
We start off the show by exploring how he got into programming, the stack he currently uses, and moving from a Monolith Laravel application to Golang microservices (deployed using ECS).
From here, we move on to highlight his time developing the popular PHP OAuth 2.0 Server package, and how he first got interested in the AWS platform.
We then discuss the power of composing services offered by AWS together, the concept of being 'cloud-proof' and the AWS certification system.
Finally, we talk about his upcoming S3 master-class video series, use of Terraform for IaC and experiences building/shipping an iOS application.
