In our 51st podcast we temporarily revert to a midweek recording of the show.
This essentially means we were all a bit tired and delirious, leading to some fantastic randomness, none more than Lew's 'different' introduction to the show. We will let you be judges of that!
Following our usual discussion of how things are panning out in our working week, we then move on to discuss some of the interesting security issues cropping up on Michael's university course.
Also, Fraser has landed an exciting new job in London, Lew has found front-end dependency bliss with Bower and Edd is doing some exciting stuff at work too.
We also talk about asset file compression/concatenation and issues we've encountered with those too.
So... plenty to discuss, in fact too much to cram in to our usual hour so we will continue the theme next time.
Enjoy folks, and as ever, thanks for listening and for your feedback.
