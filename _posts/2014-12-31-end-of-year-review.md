In this weeks episode Mick and Edd reflect on their busy years.
We first discuss how work has wrapped up for the new year, and how subtle design changes result in huge benefits.
Following this, we compare our personal experiences with product and agency work - chatting about the different programming design mindsets and work-flows used in each case.
This leads on to the well-timed appreciation for the work of Martin Fowler, Uncle Bob and Greg Young - inc. valuable tests, the importance of a name and there not being a single 'silver bullet' to solving a problem.
Finally, we wrap up with what we both would like to learn this upcoming year and Edd's experiences building a mega PC for a friend.
