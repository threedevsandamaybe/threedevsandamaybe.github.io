In this weeks show we follow up the discussion on CodeIgniter with an introduction to Laravel.
Introduced only a few years ago, the framework has been a 'breath of fresh air' in the PHP framework landscape.
Starting with a brief history of the project and how it has evolved, we move on to highlight key features of the framework that set it apart.
One such inclusion is the extensive use of an IoC container, and how Facades cater for an expressive code-base.
