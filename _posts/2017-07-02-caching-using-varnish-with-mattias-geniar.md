In this weeks episode we discuss the Varnish 'HTTP accelerator' with Mattias Geniar.
We start off the show with the problem Varnish is trying to solve, how it decides to cache content and the power within its' request/response life-cycle.
We then move on to highlight testing strategies, tools to gain insight into your Varnish instance and cache invalidation options (Purging vs. Banning).
Finally, we touch upon Edge Side Includes, Mattias's own podcast and his new DNS Spy product.
