In this weeks episode we are lucky to have Liam McLennan on the show.
We start off discussion with his Math background, how he got into programming and how it can be seen as Applied Mathematics.
From here we move on to highlight his experiences whilst consulting, what it entailed, and the importance of 'tact'.
This leads us on to look into what drew him to Functional programming, F# and creating Pluralsight courses.
Finally, we delve into the different areas of the Nokia Ringtone Composer Emulator from his F# Fundamentals course.
