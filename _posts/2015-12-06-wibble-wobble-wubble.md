On this week's ramble podcast we are joined by the Macintosh Speech Synthesis Manager!?
We start of the show with discussion on dedicated full-text indexing search solutions, followed by conversation on random domains that we may have purchased in the past.
We then move on to chat about blogging solutions, the small refactoring cycles vs. full rewrites decision and what a design pattern truly is.
Edd then goes off on a tangent about the 'curse' of the DRY principle, followed by the use of traits over conventional OOP concepts.
Finally, we wrap up the show touching upon HTTP and how it is favourable to try and put off caching until it is justifiably needed.
