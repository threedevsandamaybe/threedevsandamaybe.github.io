After a month 'off the airwaves', Mick and Edd are back to delve into several topics that have been keeping them interested.
We start off by going down the Cryptocurrency rabbit-hole, highlighting the internal technologies that make up Bitcoin and its practical use-cases.
Edd's ramblings touch upon Satoshi, Cypherpunks, Merkle trees, Consensus algorithms, Hard forks, Segregated witness, Mining, Peta-hashes and much more...
Once Edd (finally) lets Mick talk, we move on to chat about a book Mick is reading on Scrum, and question some different Agile practises.
Finally, we ask the burning question 'What is the Internet, Anyway?'.
