It is two days before Christmas but that will not stop us from recording a new episode.
This week we discuss Frasers gambling hot-streak at Ascot, Micks move and how horrible Martinis are.
We then move on to how Fraser is getting on in his new job up in London and Micks University presentation on Fuzzy Logic.
This leads us on to how 'unrandom' humans are, and professional Rock-Paper-Scissors tournaments.
Finally, Edd brings up some interesting talks by Greg Young (on EventStore) and Rich Hickey (on software design).
Have a great Christmas everyone and thanks for your loyal listenership!
