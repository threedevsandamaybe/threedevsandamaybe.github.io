In this weeks episode we are lucky to be joined again by Scott Arciszewski.
We start off the show by discussing the difference between Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption, what Authenticated Encryption is and how secret-keys are exchanged using Diffie-Hellman.
From here, we move on to highlight how Elliptic-curve cryptography works, what DNSCrypt is and why prime numbers are so important in cryptography.
Finally, we touch upon multi-factor authentication, how one time passwords work, SMS vulnerabilities and how to manage password recovery.
