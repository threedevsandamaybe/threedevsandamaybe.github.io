On this weeks episode we are lucky to be joined by Matt Davis.
We start off the show with discussion surrounding how Matt got into programming, the Symfony certification system and his experiences working with both Symfony and Laravel.
With Edd's recent guest appearance on Full Stack Radio just being released, we then touch upon this experience and the PostgreSQL topics covered.
Following this we chat about working with external API's, testing logic dependent on these services and how Matt has been using RabbitMQ and the Laravel Queue abstraction.
This leads us on to discuss the concept of queued work in more depth, along with how to design computation in such a manner.
Finally, we chat about the pros n' cons of moving away from jQuery and back to vanilla JavaScript.
