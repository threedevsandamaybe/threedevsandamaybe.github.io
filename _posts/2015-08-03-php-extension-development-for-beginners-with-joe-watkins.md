In our very first screencast episode, we were very lucky to chat with PHP core developer Joe Watkins, discussing PHP 5 and 7 Extension Development for Beginners.
Starting off by checking out the latest PHP source code from GitHub - we move on to installing the development environment required from scratch, within Linux.
We then compile a basic CLI version of PHP for development purposes, verifying the installation using the provided tests. Finally, we wrap up the show by creating a simple 'array_sum' PHP extension clone using the provided 'ext_skel'. 
This example highlights the use of macros and common array based actions that take place in a typical extension.
