In this weeks episode we are lucky to have Keyvan Akbary back on the show.
We start off by discussing the job role he has taken since moving back to Madrid, and the importance of building autonomous teams.
From here, we talk about the technology stack they are using at Cabify, highlighting some of the interesting features found in Elixir and Go.
Finally, we touch upon Cabify's infrastructure and deployment strategy, showcasing how awesome GitLab is along the way.
