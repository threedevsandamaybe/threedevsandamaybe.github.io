In this years first episode we start off the show with discussion on Lew's newly updated website, Bowling Game Code Katas and PostgreSQL.
We then move on to talk about React-Router, 'shrinkwrapping' NPM dependences and Edd's introduction to the world of Lisp by way of Clojure.
Other coding katas are then mentioned (FizzBuzz), along with an interesting project good friend of the show Jimmy Burrell has recently released.
Finally, we wrap up the show with ideas on the technologies and languages each of us wishes to explore this year, along with some interesting podcast episodes we have recently listened to.
