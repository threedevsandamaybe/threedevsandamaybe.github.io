Hey folks, Edd, Lew and Fraser are back this evening for a good ol' web/anything else catchup.

We begin with our usual catch up, Lew discusses his CMS migration to Laravel and also the discussion to make it more API based. Edd then talks about some new caching mechanisms he has been using recently and Fraser rounds off by discussing the difficulties with making a gaming app and how tough it is working with the infinite platforms available. We also announce some exciting news regarding a live show coming up this Autumn!

Following that, we discuss the difficult CMS 'problem' and our own experiences with this before Edd finally rounds off with a mathematical dilemma.

If this doesn't whet your appetite, nothing will. Enjoy :-)
