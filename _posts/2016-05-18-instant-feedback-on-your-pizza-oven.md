On this weeks episode Edd and Mick start off discussion around productivity, quick feedback cycles with clients and building pizza ovens.
We then move on to chat about how Edd 'maybe' accident prone, how MVCC works at a high-level and why you need to vacuum your tables in Postgres.
Finally, we bring up Uncle Bob's recent 'Type Wars' article and highlight the different variants of typing (static, dynamic, weak and strong).
